## What Each Permission Does

### 1. INTERNET (Android)
**What it does**: Allows app to make network requests
**Used for**:
- Booking submissions to your backend
- Price calculations via API
- Communicating with `awt.eu.pythonanywhere.com`

**User experience**:
- ✅ Automatically granted (no popup)
- ✅ User never sees this permission
- ✅ Required for app to function

### 2. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE (Android)
**What it does**: Checks if device is connected to internet
**Used for**:
- Showing "No internet" message before trying to submit
- Better error handling
- Avoiding unnecessary API calls when offline

**User experience**:
- ✅ Automatically granted (no popup)
- ✅ User never sees this permission

### 3. ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION (Android & iOS)
**What it does**: Gets precise GPS coordinates
**Used for**:
- "Use my location" button
- Auto-filling pickup address
- Calculating accurate taxi fare

**User experience** (Android):
```
User clicks "Use my location"
  ↓
Popup appears: "Allow Vienna Airport Taxi to access this device's location?"
  ↓
User chooses:
  - "While using the app" ✅ (Recommended)
  - "Only this time" ✅
  - "Deny" ❌ (User must type address manually)
```

**User experience** (iOS):
```
User clicks "Use my location"
  ↓
Popup appears: "Allow 'Vienna Airport Taxi' to use your location?"
Message shown: "We need your location to calculate taxi fare and
                provide accurate pickup address for your airport transfer."
  ↓
User chooses:
  - "Allow While Using App" ✅ (Recommended)
  - "Allow Once" ✅
  - "Don't Allow" ❌ (User must type address manually)
```

### 4. ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION (Android)
**What it does**: Gets approximate location (city/neighborhood level)
**Used for**:
- Fallback if precise location unavailable
- Less battery-intensive alternative
- Still useful for fare estimation

**User experience**:
- Same popup as fine location
- Android may use this instead of GPS to save battery
