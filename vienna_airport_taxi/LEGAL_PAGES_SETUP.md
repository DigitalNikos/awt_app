**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Project**: Vienna Airport Taxi
**Status**: All legal page links added with language support!

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Footer Links with Language Support

**File**: `lib/presentation/widgets/footer/app_footer.dart`

**German Users See**:
- AGB → https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/agb
- Datenschutz → https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/datenschutz
- Impressum → https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/impressum

**English Users See**:
- Terms & Conditions → https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/en/terms-and-conditions
- Privacy Policy → https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/en/privacy-policy
- Imprint → https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/en/imprint

### 2. ✅ Clickable Terms Acceptance in Booking Form

**Files Updated**:
- `lib/presentation/screens/booking/from_airport/step3_screen.dart`
- `lib/presentation/screens/booking/to_airport/step3_screen.dart`

**What Users See** (Step 3 - Before submitting booking):

```
☐ Ich akzeptiere die [AGB] und die [Datenschutzerklärung]
     (German)              ↑ clickable      ↑ clickable

☐ I accept the [Terms & Conditions] and [Privacy Policy]
   (English)        ↑ clickable              ↑ clickable
```

**Behavior**:
- Click "AGB" or "Terms & Conditions" → Opens website in browser
- Click "Datenschutzerklärung" or "Privacy Policy" → Opens website in browser
- User MUST check the box before submitting booking
- If unchecked → Error message: "Bitte akzeptieren Sie die AGB und Datenschutzerklärung"

---

## How It Works

### Language Detection

The app automatically detects the user's language and shows the correct links:

```dart
final locale = Localizations.localeOf(context);
final isEnglish = locale.languageCode == 'en';

// German user:
if (!isEnglish) {
  opens: https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/agb
}

// English user:
if (isEnglish) {
  opens: https://www.airport-wien-taxi.com/en/terms-and-conditions
}
```

### Link Behavior

When user clicks a legal link:
1. App opens device's default browser (Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android)
2. Website loads in external browser
3. User reads the legal page
4. User returns to app
5. User can accept and continue booking
